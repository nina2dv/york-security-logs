## Inspiration
Inspired by my previous Hackathon and a data science course I have taken, I wanted to explore the [weekly security incident logs from York University.](https://www.yorku.ca/safety/reports/)

## What it does
In the home page, it shows contact information related to the community safety service and buttons for quick links. On the data page, it is a searchable and filterable spreadsheet with plots that updates to any changes.

## How we built it
Used Streamlit for the web app and pandas for the dataframe/exploratory data analysis. 

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to deploy the Streamlit app to the cloud as it may not work on certain browsers, OS, and versions of Streamlit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a multipage site that contains interactive plots.

## What we learned
Learned the basics of Streamlit.

## What's next for York Logs
I may add a folium map that visually shows where did each incident occur.
